    <h1>3D printing and the automotive industry</h1>
    <p>Rapid manufacturing technology is slowly transforming the way cars are built</p>
    <p>Even though it’s been around since the early 1980s, 3D printing technology still has a sci-fi aura surrounding it. The idea that complex three-dimensional objects could be produced by a single machine is still a fairly revolutionary concept, and it’s only recently that such machines have shrunk in size and price to be attainable by private consumers, rather than large companies.</p>
    <p>Uptake by the auto industry has also been slow. 3D printing has been useful for making one-off prototype parts for concept cars and test mules for a while now, but the technology is now starting to find applications in production cars as part quality, printing speeds and per-unit cost comes down. Conventional methods of mass-production such as injection-moulding plastic and casting metal will nearly always be more cost effective when dealing with large production volumes, but 3D printing still has plenty of real-world applications in the automotive world.</p>
